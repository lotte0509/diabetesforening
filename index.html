            <h1>By Adi Robertson | Photography by James Bareham</h1>
            <p>One month ago, I tested a virtual reality headset called the HTC Vive Pre. The Pre was a development kit created by gaming behemoth Valve and smartphone maker HTC, and it was one of the most exciting new pieces of hardware I’ve had the pleasure
                of writing about — a device that offered full-body, room-scale VR.</p>

            <h1>Consumer release</h1>
            <p>The headset above is not the Vive Pre. It’s the final consumer edition Vive that’s coming out today, although it looks almost identical — the branding is new, and the small focus rod on the bottom is ridged instead of smooth, but I still sometimes
                worry I’m picking up the wrong set by accident. What’s changed is the context. The Pre was an obviously unfinished device that never went on sale, complete with software glitches and half-finished games. The Vive is a real piece of consumer
                hardware that you can go online and pay $800 for right this minute. It’s coming out a week after the Oculus Rift, a competing headset with impeccable polish but limited ambition. So expectations for the Vive are high — and the headset
                both exceeds and falls short of them.</p>

            <h1>Roomscale VR</h1>
            <p>
                Since its first prototype was announced in early 2015, the Vive has been very clearly a full VR system, not just a headset. Besides its heavy black goggles, the system includes a pair of wireless motion controllers shaped like cupholders on sticks, and
                two "lighthouse" towers that are placed at opposite corners of a room, shooting fields of lasers for motion tracking. The Vive grew out of a prototype at Valve, and while the remotes don’t look much like gaming hardware, they’re designed
                like a slimmed-down, split-up version of the company’s more traditional Steam Controller. Each one has a clicky front trigger, a pair of side bumpers that you can press by squeezing tightly, two top buttons, and a smooth trackpad.</p>

            <h1>The controllers</h1>
            <p>The Steam Controller’s trackpad was originally meant to give PC gamers mouse-like precision on a console-style controller, but on the Vive controllers, it could easily be replaced by an ordinary d-pad for most of the experiences I’ve tried.
                The best argument for it is aesthetic: it’s the trackpad that elevates the Vive controller design from fancy Wii Remote to something truly futuristic; each pad a beautiful little circle that looks like a cyberpunk data chip or a pan of
                expensive eyeshadow. And adding an interface element that’s foreign to almost everyone is a great signal that the Vive isn’t just for people who know their way around a controller.</p>
